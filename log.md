# 100 days of code progress log

## Day 1: 15 February 2024

__Today's Learning:__ Revision of these vital concepts:

- __Git__ - It's a software installed of a computer for version control purposes
    __Version Control__ Is the act of keeping a saved copy of a stage in a task
- __Github__ - Where we are now is a website to store the information about version controlling
- __linux command line(CLI)__ Came back to some basics of the command line. Since my Operation System is a __windows__, I used __vagrant__ which is a virtual machine platform that can house a __linux__ environment
- __open source__ in which projects can be open for anyone with the skills can contribute to it to make it a whole.

## Day 2: 16 February 2024

__Today's Learning:__ Assignment from Class:

- __forked__ a repository. Tutor created a repo that we were supposed to do the following: We clone the __fork__
- __created a branch__ with the method of using using full name initials and add __/goals__. My full name is Charles Tawiah Agoe therefore my branch will look like this: `CTA/goals`. We then will make changes by enetering our goals for joining the __Slightly Techie__ schools.
- __pushed__ the changes to the remote repository.
- make __pull request__. For my changes to be joined to the original repo, i made a pull request

**team work** 
The previous day the usual class rep could not make it so i was tasked to remind the tutor on saturday about the class. After posting the reminders, this colleague reached out so we go through some concepts. So we scheduled for the evening and we went through some __git__ and __github__ flow.

## Day 3: 17 February 2024

__Today's Learning:__ Concepts from Class:

### Git and GitHub
- __assigned reviewers to a pull request__ To experience how the workflow behaves in an organisation we assigned reviewers to each other
- __approved pull requests__ Those that had the chance approved some pull requests. Others also declined with comments for corrections to be done.
### open Source
- I forked a repository that was compiling Ghanaian tech communities and I hope to add a youtube channel I know of.


## Day 4: 18 February 2024

__Today's Learning__: Open Source

- I made an addition to the repository compiling Ghanaian tech communities, where I included a youtube channel by Hannah Kwaw. It got accepted and merged. Really happy

## Day 5: 19 February 2024

__Today's Learning__: PPython concepts

- __Variable naming Convention__ A good variable name describes the data with which it contains. A descriptive name will make code reading more understandable. The following conventions are used:
    * __camel case__ : `baaYe`
    * __underscores__ : `baa_ye`

- __Name Restrictions__ 
    - Must not have spaces(only one word)
    - Can only use letters, numbers and underscores
    - cannot begin with a number

- Others

    |Valid|Invalid|
    |:---:|:---:|
    |current_balance|current-balance|
    |currentBalance|current balance (no space)|
    |account4|4account (cannot start with int)|
    |_42|42(cannot start with int)|
    |TOTAL_SUM|TOTAL_$UM (cannot have special x'ters)|
    |hello|'hello' (cannot have special x'ters)|

    - __Spam__ is a valid variable name but it is a convention to start a variable with `lowercase`
